Speech Note: Applications of Neural Networks
--------------------------------------------

Good morning everyone. I'm Shankarakumar, and my part in this project is to explain the applications of neural networks — where and how they are used in real life.

1. Image Recognition
- Neural networks are used to recognize images.
- For example: MNIST project (handwritten digit recognition), Face ID on smartphones, CCTV systems in police departments to identify faces and number plates.

2. Speech Recognition
- Voice assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa use neural networks.
- They help machines understand what we say and respond correctly in real time.

3. Medical Diagnosis
- Neural networks are used in hospitals to detect diseases from medical data.
- They help doctors identify cancer, diabetes, and heart problems faster and more accurately.

4. Drug Discovery
- In medicine, neural networks predict which drug combinations work best.
- This saves years of research and helps make new medicines faster.

5. Protein Structure Prediction (AlphaFold)
- A model called AlphaFold predicted how proteins fold — a task that would have taken 50 to 100 years.
- This was a major scientific breakthrough, and it used deep neural networks.

6. ChatGPT and Large Language Models
- Neural networks are the building blocks of tools like ChatGPT.
- They help AI understand and generate human-like text.

7. Other Applications
- Neural networks are also used in:
  - Weather forecasting
  - Brain-computer interfaces (like Neuralink)
  - Text generation and translation
  - Recommender systems (YouTube, Netflix, Instagram)
  - Stock market prediction

Conclusion
- So in short, neural networks are everywhere — in our phones, hospitals, industries, space research, and even social media. 
- They are one of the most powerful technologies driving the future.
